# Code Samples Repository

Welcome to my code samples repository! This repository contains a variety of code samples from different projects I have worked on. Below is a brief overview of the contents:

## Flight Package

The `Flight Package` folder contains code from a flight booking web application. This project utilizes Java and Spring Boot to develop REST APIs. The application is connected to and locally hosted alongside an SQL server. Key features include:

- **Spring Boot**: Used for developing RESTful APIs.
- **SQL Server**: For data storage and management.

## Gallery Page

The `GalleryPage.js` file is a sample from a drawing web application. This application provides daily prompts for artists to draw in-app and share their submissions with others. The gallery page showcases a grid of photos where users can:

- **View Larger Submissions**: Click on a photo to view a larger version via a pop-up.
- **Like/Unlike Photos**: Interact with photos through likes and unlikes.
- **Filter Submissions**: Filter by the number of likes, date posted, or randomly.
- **Visit Artist Profiles**: Navigate to the artistâ€™s profile directly from the gallery.

This file is built using **React** and interacts with an API Gateway, which connects to AWS Lambda and a DynamoDB backend.

## Doubly-Linked List (DLL)

The `DLL.java` file contains a custom implementation of a doubly-linked list. This implementation is part of a data structures library written in Java and includes:

- **Insert and Delete Functions**: Methods to insert and delete nodes at various positions in the list.
- **Sorting and Sorted Insertions**: Functions to sort the list and insert nodes in a sorted manner.
- **Search Functionality**: Methods to search through the list.

Feel free to explore these samples and see how various technologies and techniques are applied. If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out!
